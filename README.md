# Fossil AI Feedback (placeholder title)
TODO: Better title

Fossil AI Feedback is a master's research project investigating how artificial intelligence can guide users to capture higher-quality fossil images and supply essential metadata, improving image collection and fossil classification.

## Project Overview

This research explores interactive AI feedback mechanisms to help users take better photos of fossils and provide relevant metadata (e.g., location, scale, orientation). The goal is to understand how feedback can improve the quality and usefulness of fossil image data for research and automated classification.

## Research Goals

- Analyze the impact of AI-driven feedback on user behavior during fossil image collection.
- Identify effective strategies for prompting users to provide necessary metadata.
- Assess improvements in fossil classification accuracy resulting from improved data collection.
- Evaluate feedback mechanisms with a user test (questionnair)

## Methodology

- Literature review of AI feedback systems and image collection practices in citizen science projects.
- Design and evaluation of feedback prototypes (proof of concept).
- User studies to observe how feedback influences image and metadata quality.
- Analysis of collected data to measure improvements in classification and dataset utility.
