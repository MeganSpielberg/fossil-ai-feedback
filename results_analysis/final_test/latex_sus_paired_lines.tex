\caption{Individual participant SUS score trajectories across prototypes. Each gray line represents one participant's scores for all three prototypes, showing within-subject changes in perceived usability. The bold red line indicates the mean SUS score across all participants. Dashed lines represent usability benchmarks (68 = good, 50 = acceptable). This visualization reveals individual variation and overall trends in usability perception.}
