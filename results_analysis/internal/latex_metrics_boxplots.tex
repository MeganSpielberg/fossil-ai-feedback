\caption{Distribution of image quality metrics across the three prototypes. Boxplots show median (center line), interquartile range (box), and outliers (whiskers). Red diamonds indicate mean values. P1 (Baseline) had no real-time feedback, P2 (Post-Capture) provided feedback after image capture, and P3 (Real-Time) provided continuous feedback during capture. Sample sizes (n) are shown below each box.}
