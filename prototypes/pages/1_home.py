Welcome! Thank you for participating in this **fossil photography prototype study**.  

This web app consists of **three camera prototypes**. Your goal is to **capture fossil photos** using each prototype and **submit at least one photo per prototype**.  

---

### How to proceed:

1. **Prototype 1 â€“ Baseline Camera**  
   - Capture your fossil photos with the standard camera interface.  
   - Take as many photos as you like.  
   - Submit when ready.

2. **Prototype 2 â€“ Feedback After Capture**  
   - Capture a photo.  
   - You will receive **immediate quality feedback** about lighting, sharpness, and background.  
   - Adjust your next captures based on this feedback.  
   - Submit your final selection.

3. **Prototype 3 â€“ Real-time AI Feedback**  
   - The camera will provide **live quality feedback** while you frame your shot.  
   - Try to optimize your photos based on the live guidance.  
   - Submit your best shots.

### Tips for good fossil photography:
- Ensure **good lighting** (avoid dark or overexposed areas)  
- Use a **uniform background**  
- Keep the fossil **in focus and sharp**  
- Take **multiple angles or perspectives** if possible

Please go through the prototypes **in order (1 â†’ 2 â†’ 3)**.  
At the end of each prototype, make sure to **submit your photos** so your data is recorded correctly.  

Thank you for helping test these prototypes! ðŸ¦´
